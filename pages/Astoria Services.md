- Asteroid Mining - Astoria is able to mine material from any selected asteroid in the asteroid belt at a rate of 5m^3 per second, although this high rate does come at the cost of $500,000 per second of operation and material is mined in the form of tiny particles of dust that must be purified and refined
- Mass Driver- For a cost of $5/tonne per m/s delta V, Astoria's mass driver can rapidly send cargo back to anywhere in the inner solar system, although can only fire 3 [[CASSSC]]s per day due to the power draw of the mass driver
- Manufacturing - Astoria may undertake small amounts of refining and manufacture, although the heavy vibrations from mining operation mean that refined materials are 0.8 times the strength of the Earth-refined materials, and the cost is 1.2 times as much
- With its position in the Asteroid Belt, Astoria is the first step into the outer solar system and may be used as a staging post for small research missions as they set off into the outer solar system, although refueling here is twice as expensive as at [[Alexandriat]]
