- With the intention for great expansion on and around Mars, it was necessary for a strategic cargo marshalling facility to be established to facilitate the construction of settlements on the martian surface, and to take over this role in a more specialised manner than Aesop is currently able to provide.
- Aresam, named after the Greek name for Mars, was designed with the clear goal of being able to dock with IHPCs and to have automated systems in cargo handling to maximise the efficiency of this process. Whilst many of the challenges posed with actually surviving in the remote location that is a settlement at Mars have already been dealt with in previous misisons, Aresam must look to build on the knowlege gained from these misisons if it is to become the successful ‘Gateway To Mars’ the Foundation Society hopes for it to be!
