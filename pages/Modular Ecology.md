- Provides Potable Hydroponic & Aeroponic Systems
-
- Modular Ecology manufactures potable hydroponic and aeroponic ecosystems at Alexandriat for sustaining long duration spaceship crews. The modules attach to the exterior of a ship, over an airlock that would normally go to vacuum. New inter-orbit spacecraft are designed with appropriate interfaces as standard.
- Use of a Modular Ecology system requires that two crew members be trained to work the farm for one hour per day on average, mostly to harvest food for each dayâ€™s meals from chicken-based or agricultural systems. These deliver grains, vegetables, fruit, meat and eggs. The systems require bi-annual maintenance to replenish water and nutrients, introduce non-inbred animals, and replace plant species that have died off.
- Sizes are available for crews of five ($3,000,000), eight ($4,000,000), and twelve ($5,000,000) while special orders are reactively fulfilled. Specialised installations for more than 1000 people can be ordered for $75,000 per person plus a base charge of $12,000,000.
