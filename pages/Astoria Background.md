- With the Foundation Society’s ambitions to push crewed exploration into the outer solar system, it was essential that a major materials supply chain and manufacturing capabilities were constructed on the edge of the inner solar system. With the abundance of materials available within the asteroid belt, this was always going to be a key target for a major settlement, but many were who were sceptical as to whether the Foundation Society could establish such a settlement safely.
- Yet despite this challenge, Astoria was a great success and parallels are often drawn to the original Greek etymology of the word ‘astron’ meaning star, as Astoria does shine as one of the crowning achievements of the Foundation Society thus far, and it will act as the second major stepping stone to human expansion into the outer solar system.
