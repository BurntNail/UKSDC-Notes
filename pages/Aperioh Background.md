- Inspired by the Ancient Greek word “apeiron” meaning “that which has no boundaries”, the Foundation Society emphasise the ability of humankind to overcome even the great challenges of forging new civilisation on astronomical bodies once deemed incapable of maintaining human life. This name honours the advancements made in science and engineering capabilities within the space sector and is hoped to inspire the next generation of engineers to keep on reaching for the stars!
