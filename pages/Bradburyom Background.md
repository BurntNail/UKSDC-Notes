- The Foundation Society have announced that Bradburyom is named after Ray Bradbury, the author who anticipated human migration to Mars in “The Martian Chronicles”, and described interactions of the new human population with native Martians. Despite being a work of science fiction, the Foundation Society believe that ‘The Martian Chronicles’ contain important messages about protecting the planets and environments we call home, and so believed that through naming a settlement in Bradbury’s honour, it would serve as a constant reminder to people everywhere about the importance of this goal. This is particularly important given the purpose of Bradburyom is to being the terraforming of Mars, turning it into a second earth and allowing for a far greater influx of people to the Martian Surface.
