- Provides Cargo transport between Mars and 10,000km Mars Orbit for $5/[[CASSSC]].
-
- The OMTC Nix Space Elevator has revolutionised cargo transport within the Martian system with its ability to transfer over 1000 [[CASSSC]]s an hour between an orbit of 10,000km and the surface of Mars. For a fee of only $5 per [[CASSSC]], cargo may be transfered down to the surface and handled by the Argonom facilities ready for use or further distribution. Transport from the surface to the orbiting distribution centre comes at a cost of $20 per [[CASSSC]].

- As stated on the OMTC webpage, #[[Olympus Mons Trading Company]] are able to claim a 10% reduction in the cost of using Nix, a deal which surely ‘elevates’ any mission they are involved with in vicinity or Mars.
