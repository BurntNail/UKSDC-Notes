- In one of the few cases where a settlement name exactly replicates the name of the person it honours, it is only fitting that this settlement honours the person whose works inspired the very name of the Foundation Society, Isaac Asimov. A prolific 20th century hard science fiction writer, Asimov has a complete bibliography of 500 works, the most famous of which being the Foundation Series which collectively tell the story of the Foundation – an institute established to preserve the best parts of galactic civilisation following the collapse of the Galactic Empire.
- The Foundation Society believes that humanity can realise its potential as a galactic society through rapid advancements in technology, quoting Asimov’s idea of ‘positronic’ robots as one of the many advances they believe society will make in the next century as part of the quest towards humanities expansion beyond our solar system.
