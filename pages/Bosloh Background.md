- Bosloh is by far the largest settlement on the Hermian surface (or rather beneath it) with an Initial Operating Capacity of 10,000 that has since been expanded by a further 15,000 as more and more facilities are built, and maglev train connections between them established. The discovery of lava tubes on Mercury by [[Aperioh]] was essential for allowing the construction of this settlement, which is now able to help sustain the other Hermian settlements. With its primary mission as a mining settlement, Bosloh not only facilitates the construction of the other settlements around Mercury, but is also a key revenue generator for the Foundation Society and drives the economy of the inner planets.
