- Estimating Costs:
	- Get in the right OOM.
	- Possibly use a spreadsheet.
	- If you can use a [[Subcontractor]], do, else just get the current costs, downscale and give a reasonable reason.
	- There is a bit of 'artistic license', so make an end figure and fiddle around a bit
- Getting technical info:
	- Look at NASA stuff - [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/)
	- Look at journals.
		- Sort by style - eg. press release
	- Look at BSA
	- You don't need to go to Uni/Doctorate levels of detail
	- You could even use Wikipedia, Wired, Space.com, or even Ars Technica.
- General Feedback:
	- A lot better than last time
	- Nice diagrams
	- Try to make as much as possible in house.
	- Think like a company, don't just tell it, sell it - https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/682/space-tourism-posters/
	- Good to have RFPs/Page Nos on each page
