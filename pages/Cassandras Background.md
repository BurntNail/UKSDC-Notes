- Whilst [[Benevectoras]] was a revolutionary design in terms of providing mass, low cost transport between earth and mars, some complained of the fact that the transfer time was far longer than was appreciated, particularly for passengers. This led the Foundation Society to explore the use of different cycle orbital trajectories for Cassandras, allowing for a 48% reduction in transfer times. Comprising 30 identical settlements, Cassandras was more specifically designed to accomodate large numbers of passangers, with a slight reduction in cargo capacity. However this added quality of transfer vehicle and reduction in transfer time does come with a higher associated cost than the use of [[Benevectoras]] (especially as getting to and from the Cassandras orbit requires a large amount of fuel).
