- The settlement Anaximandah is named after the Ancient Greek philosopher and astronomer Anaximander who was the first recorded person to try and apply non-mythological explanations for cosmology. He was the first person to conceive the idea that the earth was a free floating object in space, allowing for the revolution in cosmological thinking that objects could pass under the earth, opening the way to Greek Astronomy.
- The Foundation Society deemed it only fitting to name a settlement in an orbit around Mercury – a planet whose orbit has since brought a shift in cosmological thinking through providing evidence for General Relativity – after Anaximander, in order to highlight the great shift in cosmological thinking brought around by his own ideas so many centuries prior.
