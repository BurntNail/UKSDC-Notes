- A collection of 6 identical settlements seperated in space, Benevectoras refers to a group of spacecraft in Aldrin Cycler orbits between earth and mars. The use of 6 settlements means that there is a transfer window every 8 months and these settlements take 146 days to complete the transfer. The fact that Benevectoras is in a cycler orbit means that it requires minimal propulsion to get people and cargo between earth and the red planet, allowing for cheap passage of large amounts of material.
